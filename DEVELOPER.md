# Developer Guide

## Shipping Guidelines

According to the Git Flow workflow, feature branches and bug fixes will be merged into `develop` via pull requests.

### Git Flow Start

Install:

```bash
apt-get install git-flow
```

**Init:**

Git Flow will ask us a series of questions from the terminal, we will answer by default (simply by pressing enter) each and every one of them. \
If we want to avoid this step, using the -d flag all default configurations will be established.

```bash
git flow init
```

Example:

```bash
Which branch should be used for bringing forth production releases?
   - develop
   - master
Branch name for production releases: [master]

Which branch should be used for integration of the "next release"?
   - develop
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop]

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/]
Bugfix branches? [bugfix/]
Release branches? [release/]
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
Support branches? [support/]
Version tag prefix? []
Hooks and filters directory? [/Users/your-user/Sites/your-dirname]
```

By default, master will be our main branch, develop will be our development branch, new feature branches will be prefixed with feature/, branches to fix small bugs that have not reached production will be prefixed with bugfix/, branches to put Code in production will be prefixed with release/, bugfix branches in production will be prefixed with hotfix/, and support branches will be prefixed with support/.

### Features

When we are going to develop a new feature, or evolve/modify an existing one, we will use feature branches. \
For this Git Flow offers us the git flow feature command.

**feature:**

List existing feature branches

```bash
git flow feature
```

**Start:**

Create a feature branch. The name is mandatory (the prefix "feature/" will be automatically added), the base is optional and would allow us to create the feature from a specific branch. If it is not indicated, the default is developed

```bash
git flow feature start <name> [<base>]
```

**Publish:**

Upload the branch to the remote repository

```bash
git flow feature publish <name>
```

**Finish and Delete:**

They are replaced by merge request using GitLab

**Track:**

Used to track a feature branch that was created by another user on the team. This is useful when you are collaborating on a feature and want to sync your local repository with the remote version of that feature branch.

```bash
git flow feature track <name>
```

### Bugfix

If a bug is detected that has not yet reached production, we will make a bugfix. \
For this Git Flow offers us the git flow bugfix command. \
Bugfixes will be merged against develop.

**bugfix:**

List existing bugfix branches

```bash
git flow bugfix
```

**Start:**

Create a bugfix branch. The name is required (the prefix "bugfix/" will be automatically added, \
The base is optional and would allow us to create the bugfix from a specific branch. \
If not indicated, the default is developed

```bash
git flow bugfix start <name>
```

**Publish:**

Upload the branch to the remote repository

```bash
git flow bugfix publish <name>
```

**Finish and Delete:**

They are replaced by merge request using GitLab

## Guidelines for confirmation messages

We use commit messages to automatically generate the changelog and version, so it is important that you follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.

### Commitlint

Commitlint is a tool that allows us to validate the commit messages, and thus be able to standardize them. \
It is based on a configuration file, which is usually called commitlint.config.js, and in which we can define the rules that we want to apply to the commit messages.

Install:

```bash
npm install -g @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
```

### Branch lint

Branch lint is a tool that allows us to validate the branch names, and thus be able to standardize them. \
It is based on a configuration file, which is usually called .branchlintrc, and in which we can define the rules that we want to apply to the branch names.

Install:

```bash
npm install -g branchlint
```

### Husky

What Husky is based on is Git Hooks, which are scripts that are executed at certain times, such as before a commit, push, etc... \
Husky allows us to configure these hooks in a very simple way, and also allows us configure them in the package.json, which allows us to have a more portable project.

Install:

```bash
npm install -g husky
npx husky install
```

Add hook for commitlint:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/commit-msg  'commitlint --edit ${1}'
npx husky add .husky/pre-push  'branchlint'
```
